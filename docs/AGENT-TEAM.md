# void --news Agent Team Structure

Last updated: 2026-05-03 (rev 28 — frontend-builder completed mobile UX pass + PWA service worker + Capacitor iOS/Android shell init)

## Philosophy

Adapted from DondeAI. Every principle inherited and tailored for a news bias analysis platform.

### Core Principles

1. **No Hierarchical Delegation** — Agents cannot spawn other agents. Task routing at the human level.
2. **Read-First Protocol** — Every agent reads CLAUDE.md + relevant docs before any work.
3. **Execution Protocol** — Assess → Plan → Build → Verify → Report. No exceptions.
4. **Max Blast Radius** — Max 4 CSS, 2 JS/TS, 3 Python files per run.
5. **Claude Max CLI for agent work; Sonnet 4.6 API for editorial LLM** — All agent/dev work via Claude Code CLI ($0). Pipeline editorial LLM (summaries, briefs, opinion, weekly) routes through Claude Sonnet 4.6 with smart-routed Gemini fallback (~$30/mo target). Rule-based NLP and edge-tts audio remain $0.
6. **Parallel-Safe vs Sequential** — Read-only agents can run simultaneously. Write agents require sequencing.

### Cost Policy

```
COST BUDGET: ~$30/month editorial LLM (Sonnet 4.6); rest is $0

Pipeline NLP:      Rule-based (spaCy, NLTK, TextBlob)              — $0
Editorial LLM:     Claude Sonnet 4.6 primary (~57 calls/run × 1 run/day)
                   $3 in / $15 out per MTok, ephemeral prompt cache — ~$30/mo
LLM Fallback:      Gemini Flash free tier (~250 RPD legacy limit)  — $0
Audio TTS:         edge-tts (Microsoft Neural)                     — $0
Database:          Supabase free tier                              — $0
Hosting:           GitHub Pages                                    — $0
CI/CD:             GitHub Actions free tier                        — $0
Agent work:        Claude Code CLI (Max subscription)              — $0
```

Anthropic console budget cap recommended at $50/month (60% buffer over $30 target).

## Parallel Safety

**Can run simultaneously (read-only):** `pipeline-tester`, `db-reviewer`, `void-ciso`, `ceo-advisor`, `uat-tester`, `historiographic-auditor`

**Never simultaneous:** Two write agents on overlapping files; `bug-fixer` + `pipeline-tester`; `frontend-builder` + `frontend-fixer`.

---

## Locked Decisions (CEO Approval)

- Cinematic Press design system (4-voice type, BiasLens Three Lenses, newspaper grid + cinematic tokens)
- 6-axis bias scoring model
- Supabase as single data layer
- Static export (Next.js → GitHub Pages)
- 1,013-source curated list (3 tiers: 43 us_major, 373 international, 597 independent); 7-point lean spectrum; 158 countries
- ~$30/mo LLM cost target (Sonnet 4.6 primary, Gemini fallback); broken intentionally from prior $0 ceiling for editorial quality
- 1x/day pipeline cadence; top-50 homepage feed
- Claude Max CLI for all agent work

---

## Future Expansion

R&I advisory agents (read-only, propose but don't implement):

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data-storytelling-designer` | Bias visualization, chart design |
| `micro-interaction-designer` | Progressive disclosure, delight |
| `accessibility-inclusivity-lead` | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance |

`motion-physics-designer` was promoted to `cinematographer` + `motion-director` + `vfx-artist` (Cinematic Division, rev 12).
